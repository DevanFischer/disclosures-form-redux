        "Message": "The ACP monthly service and device discounts are not transferrable to other households or individuals. An eligible household is limited to one monthly service discount and one device discount. Eligibility for the ACP will be determined by the National Verifier and National Lifeline Accountability Database, administered by the Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC), or an alternative verification process approved by the FCC. ACP benefits may be obtained from any participating provider of your choosing and your monthly service benefit may be transferred to another provider at any time. ACP discounts can be applied to any available Red Pocket Mobile service plans. Upload/download speeds will be determined by your particular service plan, and other factors, including your device, network availability from our underlying carrier, your proximity to cellular towers, and environmental factors may affect speeds, as described at www.redpocket.com. Our standard Terms and Conditions, including the Acceptable Use Policy, apply and are available at www.redpocket.com. Lifeline program participants are eligible to participate in the ACP. Your ACP benefit is separate from your Lifeline benefit. Your household can receive only one Lifeline and one ACP benefit. Your ACP benefit can be separate or combined with your Lifeline benefit, depending on the service plan you choose. Lifeline participants may maintain their existing Lifeline services without enrolling in the ACP, and may choose to take ACP benefits from another service provider. If the FCC announces the end the ACP, we discontinue our ACP service offers, or we determine your household is no longer eligible, we will notify you and you will revert to receiving the standard FREE Lifeline plan where available and if you are eligible. You may keep your service plan by paying the applicable undiscounted rate plus applicable fees and taxes."
