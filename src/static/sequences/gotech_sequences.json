For a limited time determined by the FCC, unemployment may qualify you for Lifeline and the ACP. Additional eligibility programs are unique to ACP and do not qualify for Lifeline. These include Pell Grants, Free and Reduced-Price School Lunch and Breakfast, as well as reduced wages in certain instances. Program eligibility will be determined for the FCC by Universal Service Administrative Company's National Verifier and National Lifeline Accountability Database, or an alternative verification process approved by the FCC."
